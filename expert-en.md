## Add custom code

If you want to add custom code, like `font-face` or statistical code (such as `Google Analytics`) to your site, you need to create a folder named `_data` (no rename) in the `source` folder in your site directory.

Then create a file called `head.yml` in the file:

```yaml
Name:
    "Put your code here"
```

The code will be displayed before `</head>` tag. `Name` will appear as a comment above the code.

## Palette

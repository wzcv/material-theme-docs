### Thumbnail function

In the Material theme, each Scheme has a thumbnail function. Simply add the `thumbnail:` parameter to the `front-matter` and fill in the thumbnail address.

#### Paradox

This scheme uses the default random thumbnails if there is no custom thumbnail. The random thumbnail directory is located under the `source/img/random` folder. You can add your favorite images in the format `material-<num>.png`. Then modify the `random_amount` parameter in the **theme config**.

#### Isolation

This Scheme will only show thumbnails that have been customized.

## Create the "About" page

Create a new `about` page:

```shell
hexo new page "About"

If you want to add a link to the "Link" page, please refer to the [page settings](/en/intro/#pages).

## Create the "Links" page

### Create the page

```

If you want to add a link to the "Link" page, please refer to the [page settings](/en/intro/#pages).

### Add data

Create a folder named `_data` (rename is forbidden) within the `source` folder. Then create a file named `links.yml` inside this folder.

The format for a single link is:

```yaml
Name:
    link: http://example.com

```

Change `Name` to the name of the link. You can create as many links as you want.
